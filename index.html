    <h1>MY I.T. PERSONAL PROFILE</h1>
    <h2>Personal Information</h2>
    <p><span class="style1">Note to marker: some items are obviously fake so as to protect me from identity theft. Student # is correct.</span><br />
    </p>
    <h2>My name is Theophilus P. Wilderbeast.</h2>
    <h2>Student number: s0157832 (true)</h2>
    <h2>email address: wilderbeast@zoo.com.za</h2>
    <p>I am 25 years of age, the son of the late former deputy finance minister of Ghana. My father was jailed after he has been probed and found guilty of embezzlement of government funds and most especially diverting a fund donated by the Japanese government for the Keta sea defense project.<br />
        <br />
        <br />
      All effort made by our family and my mother to get him out of jail proved to no avail and my father died due to his detracting cardiac health problem. On account of this, my mother and I have thought it is wise for me to go to abroad with the documents of the remaining properties that my late father left for me, especially a $6.5 Million USD dollars that my father deposited in a bank here in Ghana.<br />
      <br />
        So I decided to call on you to assist in transferring this fund and investing it in a lucrative business venture in your country under your supervision and care so that after the fund has been properly secured I will then come down to meet you and send my mother some funds for the sake of my siblings/two young sisters to be taken care of. <br />
        <br />
      Presently, my family condition is too critical.<br />
      <br />
        Note that all relevant documents in respect of this are still intact with me. Your willingness to assist in this bank to bank transfer, I will forward all documents and details to you so we can discuss better on important partnership terms before we proceed. I am prepared to allocate 30% for your assistance, 5% for expenses. God richly bless you and your family.<br />

    <h2>(MEN ONLY PLEASE) One interesting fact about myself
    </h2>
    <p>A certain part of my anatomy is exactly 12 inches long - but, like the Pope, I don't use it as a rule. <br />
      <br />
    I told my friend it got shot off during the Iraq war, so my friend used to trust me alone with his girlfriend.<br />
    <br /> 
    One day he caught us.<br />
    <br />  
    &quot;You told me it got shot off during the war!&quot; he complained. <br />
    <br />
    &quot;It did. But it left a 9-inch stump.&quot;, I explained.</p>
    <h2>What is your interest in IT?</h2>
    <p>Programming mainly. I love to write Windows Apps and sell them online.</p>
    <h2>When did your interest in IT start?</h2>
    <p>I bought a Disck Smith VZ200 computer in 1987. It has a Z80A processor which I'd studied at RMIT. I started advertising and selling custom programs in the backpage classifieds of Electronics Australia that year. Glorious times. I was a pioneer and felt special. <br />
      <br />
    <h2>
    Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? </h2>
    <p>Circa 1986: All the guys at work (Telecom) who were  getting promotions had one thing in common: IT. They were running spreadsheets and databases (eg. DBase III+ by Ashton-Tate) . I thought &quot;I'd better get into that.&quot; I enrolled in a C Programming course that year.<br />
    <br />
    <h2>Outline your IT experience (if any).</h2>
    <p>Hardware / Progammer / Tech Support  30+ years</p>
    <h2>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h2>
    <p>I have studied with  RMIT in the past.<br />
    </p>
    <h2>What do you expect to learn during your studies?<br />
    </h2>
    <p>The latest tech...........and to fill any gaps in my learning. I am mostly self-taught in IT.</p>
    <h2>Ideal Job</h2>
    <p>Teacher of IT secondary schools. </p>
    <p>Find an advertisement showing what you believe to be your ideal job. This may require several years of experience, and hence be somethingthat you must work towards, rather than something that you are ready for now, or will be able to fill as soon as you graduate.</p>

    </p>
    <h2> Skills, qualifications and experience required for the position.</h2>
        <p>Graduate Diploama in Techology Education.<br />
        Bachelor of IT</p>

    <h2>Personal Profile</h2>
    <h3>Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)</h3>
    <p>I am EVIL.The results of an online Myers-Briggs test.</p>
    <h3> The results of an online learning style test.</h3>
    <p>I am EVIL<br />
    </p>
    <h3>Big Five Personality test</h3>
    <p>I am EVIL </p>
    <h3> What do the results of these tests mean for you?<br />
    </h3>
    <p>The theory of original sin is obviously a fact.<br />
      <br />
      The tests show amazingly consistent results and their results are to be trusted always, without question. <br />
    </p>
    <h3> How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?<br />
    </h3>
    <p>I must win at all costs.<br />
    </p>
    <h3> How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
    <p>I must be the team leader.<br />
        <br />
    </p>
    <h3>What are you passionate about?</h3>
    <p>My  forthcoming retirement. But I now have to wait to 67 for a pension.</p>
    <h3>What kind of IT innovation would you like to see? </h3>
    <p>One use and multi-use codes for secure email. Email where you need a simple code to permit it  to be downloaded from the server. </p>
    <p>The pace of life is too fast, so a portable  EMP burster large enough to send us all back to the valve age would be nice.</p>
    <h3>What project will help you develop the skills, experience and knowledge required to make you qualified for your ideal job?</h3>
    <p>A portfolio of work related to teaching IT. Better interviewee skills.</p>
    <p><br />
    </p>
    <h2>Project Idea (1000 words)</h2>
    <h3>Word quota met because a picture is worth 1000 words?<br />
    </h3>
    <p>We will write an Monopoly style game but use it for IT learning.</p>

    <h3>Obstacles you anticipate.</h3>
    <p>Some beginner conceptual headaches relating to  C++ object methods and properties.</p>
    <h3>Skills Required<br />
    </h3>
    <p>Proficiency in: C++ and the use of the C++ Builder IDE (COMMUNITY EDITION),<br />
Understanding and Formation of: query strings, name/value pairs  <br />
    Hardware and OS: Windows PC <br />
    <br />
    Feasibility: highly probable of a successful outcome.</p>
    <h3>Outcome</h3>
    <p>The project will be successful.  I hope to pass of the joys and challenges of making it to ASSIGNMENT GROUP 1. <br />
      <br />
      The outcome will be a three-and-a-half-year-long, peace treaty in the Middle East. Then the antichrist will come.    </p>
    <p>Beyond that, I cannot tell.</p>
