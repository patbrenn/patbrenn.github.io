      My name is Theophilus P. Wilderbeast.</h1>

    <h1>I am 25 years of age, the son of the late former deputy finance minister of Ghana. My father was jailed after he has been probed and found guilty of embezzlement of government funds and most especially diverting a fund donated by the Japanese government for the Keta sea defense project.<br />
    All effort made by our family and my mother to get him out of jail proved to no avail and my father died due to his detracting cardiac health problem. On account of this, my mother and I have thought it is wise for me to go to abroad with the documents of the remaining properties that my late father left for me, especially a $6.5 Million USD dollars that my father deposited in a bank here in Ghana.</h1>
    <h1><br />
    So I decided to call on you to assist in transferring this fund and investing it in a lucrative business venture in your country under your supervision and care so that after the fund has been properly secured I will then come down to meet you and send my mother some funds for the sake of my siblings/two young sisters to be taken care of. Presently, my family condition is too critical.</h1>
    <h1><br />
      Note that all relevant documents in respect of this are still intact with me. Your willingness to assist in this bank to bank transfer, I will forward all documents and details to you so we can discuss better on important partnership terms before we proceed. I am prepared to allocate 30% for your assistance, 5% for expenses. God richly bless you and your family.<br />

    <h1><br />
    Chicken Sexer (Computerised)</h1>
    <h1>Find an advertisement showing what you believe to be your ideal job. This may require 
      several years of experience, and hence be somethingthat you must work towards, 
      rather than something that you are ready for now, or will be able to fill as soon as you 
    graduate.</h1>
    <h1><br />
      There are various ways to search for IT jobs, including websites like {seek.com.au}. 
      You should include the following information.</h1>
    <h1><br />
      • The job advertisement itself. Include a link, and asnapshot of it (in case the link expires 
      before the assignment deadline).</h1>
    <h1><br />
      • A description (in your own words) of the position, and particularly what makes this 
      position appealing to you.</h1>
    <h1><br />
      • A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience required

      for the position, building on those you have now. This need not be greatly detailed, (and 
      will probably change significantly over time anyway), but try to be as specific as you can.</h1>
    <h1><br />
      Personal Profile<br />
      There are a number of online tests that are commonly used by employers to get 
      specific information about potential employees. Oneof the best-known of these is the 
      Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) test, which was developed by the 
      mother-and-daughter team of Isabel Myers and Katharine Briggs. Another popular one 
      (and very relevant to students) is about learning styles.</h1>
    <h1><br />
      There are various other tests available online as well, and while there is no guarantee 
      that any specific test will be necessarily one thatyou will encounter in your career, it 
      seems highly likely that you will have to do some kind of test like this as part of a 
      recruitment process.</h1>
    <h1><br />
      Accordingly, you are required to present the following information:<br />
      • The results of an online Myers-Briggs test.</h1>
    <h1>EVIL<br />
    • The results of an online learning style test.</h1>
    <h1>EVIL</h1>
    <h1><br />
    • The results of one further online test of your choosing.</h1>
    <h1>EVIL<br />
    </h1>
    <h1>The third test should be distinct from both the Myers-Briggs test and the learning styles 
      test.</h1>
    <h1><br />
      This could be a Big Five Personality test, a creativity test, or a psychometric test. You 
      should be able to find something free, and please ensure that it is something that a 
      potential employer may find relevant (so please avoid things like a Nerdy Personality 
      Attribute assessment or a Generic Conspiracist Beliefs test!).</h1>
    <h1><br />
      In addition to the results themselves, you should answer each of the questions below<br />
      with one paragraph.</h1>
    <h1><br />
      • What do the results of these tests mean for you?<br />
    EVIL. </h1>
    <h1><br />
      • How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?<br />
    No good guys.</h1>
    <h1><br />
      • How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h1>
    <h1>Read above.</h1>

      describe the project itself, as well as why you think it is important or interesting, and any 
      potential drawbacks or obstacles you anticipate.<br />

      You need not have full answers to any of these questions, but you are required to have 
      some ideas about an IT project that you think will address at least one of these 
      questions. It may not be possible to find one that answers all three, but it is quite likely<br />
      that something you would find interesting or usefulwill have a similar effect on others.</h1>
    <h1><br />
      There are a number of possible types of projects that you may consider. Some potential 
      ideas are below; others will be discussed in the following weeks.<br />

      Developing a smartphone app, using whatever programming language in which you 
      have expertise, or by using tools such as MIT App Inventor.<br />

      Academic integrity and plagiarism<br />
      Academic integrity is about honest presentation of your academic work. It means acknowledging the workof others while<br />
      developing your own insights, knowledge and ideas.<br />
      You should take extreme care that you have: <br />
      1. Acknowledged words, data, diagrams, models, frameworks and/or ideas of others you have quoted (i.e.<br />
      directly copied), summarised, paraphrased, discussed or mentioned in your assessment through the<br />
      appropriate referencing methods, <br />
      2. Provided a reference list of the publication details so your reader can locate the source if necessary. This<br />
      includes material taken from Internet sites. <br />
      If you do not acknowledge the sources of your material, you may be accused of plagiarism because you have passed off the<br />
      work and ideas of another person without appropriate referencing, as if they were your own. <br />
      RMIT University treats plagiarism as a very seriousoffence constituting misconduct. <br />
      Plagiarism covers a variety of inappropriate behaviours, including:<br />
      1. Failure to properly document a source<br />
      2. Copyright material from the internet or databases<br />
      3. Collusion between students<br />
